 Machine learning is the science of computer algorithms that help machines learn and improve from data analysis without explicit programming.
 It has two types of learning one is Supervised learning and another one is unsupervised learning.
 In Supervised learning the machine is trained on a set of labeled data, which means that the input data is paired with the desired output.where we can predict based on previous data .
 Here in supervised learning it has target which is know as dependant one .In supervised learning there are two types Continuous learning and Categorical learning.
 # Continuous learning are data that can have any value within the variableâ€™s range.For example age,height, weight, temperature, time
 # Categorical learning data grouped into categories. For example gender,color,type of cars etc...
 In unsupervised learning, the machine is trained on a set of unlabeled data, which means that the input data is not paired with the desired output. 
 Based on above definition we are going to predict dataset.Here this dataset has three columns there are marks,admitted and gender.
 When analysis the data here admitted column is our target which means dependant and remaining columns are undependant one so from here we can say that this dataset is # supervised learning.
 In the Mark column the data is in contiouous form it is in variable range so here this column is know as  Continuous learning and admitted column we can predict the data here so this column is Categorical learning
 For above analysis we can conclude this dataset as # Supervised Categorical learning.
